        <b>Medicinal uses:</b>  Leaf-extract is used in dysentry, rhizome is used i stomach ulcers.<br><br>

        <![CDATA[
        <b>Century Plant</b> is an agave originally from Mexico but now cultivated worldwide.<br><br>
        It has a spreading rosette, about 4 m wide, of gray-green leaves up to 6 ft. long, each with a spiny margin and a heavy spike at the tip.<br><br>
        Its common name derives from its habit of only occasionally flowering, but when it does, the spike with a cyme of big yellow flowers, may reach up to 25 ft. in height.<br><br>
        The plant dies after flowering, but produces suckers or adventitious shoots from the base, which continue its growth.<br><br>
        The average life-span is around 25 years.<br><br>
        If the flower stem is cut without flowering, a sweet liquid called agua miel ("honey water") gathers in the heart of the plant.<br><br>
        This may be fermented to produce the drink called pulque, which may then be distilled to produce mezcal.

        However, most of us know it as a smaller foliage house plant, before much of a trunk has developed.<br><br>
        The leaves are 12-30" long, 4-6" wide and may be glossy green, reddish purple, or marked with various combinations of purple, red, yellow or white.<br><br>
        The leaves originate in tufts at the top of the woody stems in mature plants, and more or less along the stems in younger house plants.<br><br>
        Mature plants produce yellowish or reddish flowers that are sweetly scented, less than a half inch across, and clustered in conspicuous 12" panicles.<br><br>
        The fruits are red berries. Ti sometimes grows in clumps by suckering from the enlarged tuber-like rhizomes.<br><br>

        Native to China, <b>magnolia coco</b> is a wonderful plant which captures the beauty of magnolias (normally big trees) in a flower pot.<br><br>
        The flowers are small and very fragrant. They usually last only a day and open in the evening, the tepals falling by morning.<br><br>
        This species is a good houseplant, the most suitable magnolia for indoors, thanks to its small size and slow growth rate.<br><br>
        Its long flowering period provides indoor fragrance and color about nine months of a year.<br><br>
        Most of magnolias lack nectaries, but the Magnolia coco is a nice exception.<br><br>
        It secrets a nectar-like substance at the base of the tepals and between the stigmas.<br><br>
        Indoors it can be grown as a small house plant in a pot where it gets only 2-3 ft tall and blooms in young age.<br><br>
        Fragrance is outstanding especially in early morning, and reminds one of champaka.<br><br>
        This probably inspired its other names, Michelia coco and Michelia pumila.<br><br>
        This is a true magnolia - the blooms are at the ends of the branches, rather than from the leaf axils as they are in the Michelia group.

        <b>Elephant Foot Yam</b> is perhaps one of the ugliest flowers in the world and to accompany it, it has one of the worst scents that you can imagine.<br><br>
        Its hard to get close to the flower when its releasing its smell.<br><br>
        But the foul odor only lasts for a few hours after the flower opens.<br><br>
        The plant only blooms when mature and even so it doesnt bloom every year.<br><br>
        Flowers last only about 5 days. Even more interesting, during this phase the plant generates heat.<br><br>
        The heat and the smell mimics rotting flesh to attract the flies that will pollinate the flower.<br><br>
        Elephant yam is a striking aroid with a flower spike crowned with a bulbous maroon knob and encircled by a fleshy maroon and green-blotched bract.<br><br>
        The solitary leaf, which emerges after the flowering parts, resembles a small tree.<br><br>
        In India this species as a crop is grown mostly in Bihar, West Bengal, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Orissa.<br><br>
        <b>Medicinal uses:</b> The elephant-foot yam is widely used in Indian medicine and is recommended as a remedy in all three of the major Indian medcinal systems: Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani.<br><br>
        The corm is prescribed for bronchitis, asthma, abdominal pain, emesis, dysentery, enlargement of spleen, piles, elephantiasis, diseases due to vitiated blood, and rheumatic swellings.<br><br>
        Pharmacological studies have shown a variety of effects, specifically antiprotease activity, analgesic activity, and cytotoxic activity.<br><br>
        In addition it has been found to be a potentiator for further reducing bacteria activity when used with antibiotics.
